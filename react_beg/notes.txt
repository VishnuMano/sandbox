Section 2: Creating Content with JSX

5 Step Process to Create/Display a Component
1. Import the React and ReactDOM Libraries
- React Library -> defines what a component is and how multiple components work together.
- ReactDOM Library -> knows how to get a component to show up in the broswer.
2. Get a reference to the div with ID root
3. Tell React to take control of that element
4. Create a component
5. Show the component on the screen
